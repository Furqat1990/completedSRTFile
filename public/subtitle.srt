00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,720
This Data Viewer

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,800
going to a derived column

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,000
is so useful that I'll be using it

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,770
in future lectures.

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,460
So don't be worried

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,250
if I'm putting a derived column

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,430
and not actually explaining it.

8
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,673
It would be so that I can check the output.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,710
Now, we got 847 rows here,

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,020
but sometimes, of course, quantity does not equal quality.

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,930
Suppose you had 10 million rows

12
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,500
and you were trying to just look through that

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,010
for representative samples.

14
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,600
It can be quite too much.

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,080
What you can do is you can trim it down

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,220
to a smaller sample,

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,170
and there are two ways you can do that.

18
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,810
You can do it, and you will need to look

19
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,830
in under other transforms for this,

20
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,823
by row sampling or percentage sampling.

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,573
So row sampling, as you can see,

22
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,693
samples a specific number of rows from an input.

23
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,773
So if we put this in and configure it,

24
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,330
it by default will get you 10 rows.

25
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,173
I'm gonna increase that to 25,

26
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,930
and you can see

27
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,350
that we have two outputs.

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,720
We have the selected's output

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,270
and the unselected output,

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,103
and we have the standard column tab.

31
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,500
So let's add

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,183
two derived columns.

33
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,090
So this one is the selected,

34
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,360
and this one is the unselected.

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,538
So we'll call that selected

36
00:01:39,538 --> 00:01:42,150
and unselected.

37
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,410
So let's see what happens.

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,340
So 847 go in,

39
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,120
25 goes into selected,

40
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,060
822 goes into unselected.

41
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,290
So let's put on a Data Viewer

42
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,060
but only on the selected

43
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,280
because it's otherwise causing us

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,040
a few problems to have two Data Viewers open.

45
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,560
So here we have one,

46
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,840
and we start off with,

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,523
if you just have a look at the CustomerID,

48
00:02:08,523 --> 00:02:10,970
290, 29740,

49
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,440
296474, and then number four.

50
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,423
So it really is random.

51
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,433
If I do it again,

52
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,470
so remember number four was at last time,

53
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,690
is number four part of that this time?

54
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,523
No.

55
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,830
Of course, I couldn't be sure

56
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,300
until I actually ran it.

57
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,133
It is random.

58
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,720
Number four could well have been there this time.

59
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,690
Now if you want a random sample

60
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,400
but not so random, you want to be able to repeat it,

61
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,520
you can specify the random seed,

62
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,660
and have a look at this.

63
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,520
Using the same random seed on the same input data

64
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,820
always generates the same sample.

65
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,930
So using for development and testing your package.

66
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,740
Absolutely, you don't want to do it in real life.

67
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,010
So now let's have a look

68
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,490
at these random rows, and you can see

69
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,550
it starts off at row number 40,

70
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,720
and if I do it again,

71
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,313
it will still start off at row number 40.

72
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,480
So that is just the random sampling

73
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,010
in a nut shell.

74
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,230
We also have percentage sampling,

75
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,710
which instead of saying 10 rows,

76
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,620
we want, say, 10%,

77
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,820
but I'll leave it for you to have a look at that

78
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,693
in one of the practise activities.

79
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,553
For now, let's go on to a different practise activity.
