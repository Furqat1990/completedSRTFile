00:00:00,720-->00:00:09,770
This Data Viewer going to a derived column is so useful that I'll be using it in future lectures.

2
00:00:09,770-->00:00:15,430
So don't be worried if I'm putting a derived column and not actually explaining it.

3
00:00:15,430-->00:00:17,673
It would be so that I can check the output.

4
00:00:20,560-->00:00:22,710
Now, we got 847 rows here,

5
00:00:22,710-->00:00:27,020
but sometimes, of course, quantity does not equal quality.

6
00:00:27,020-->00:00:34,010
Suppose you had 10 million rows and you were trying to just look through that for representative samples.

7
00:00:34,010-->00:00:36,600
It can be quite too much.

8
00:00:36,600-->00:00:41,220
What you can do is you can trim it down to a smaller sample,

9
00:00:41,220-->00:00:43,170
and there are two ways you can do that.

10
00:00:45,080-->00:00:49,830
You can do it, and you will need to look in under other transforms for this,

11
00:00:49,830-->00:00:52,823
by row sampling or percentage sampling.

12
00:00:56,120-->00:00:58,573
So row sampling, as you can see,

13
00:00:59,830-->00:01:02,693
samples a specific number of rows from an input.

14
00:01:03,860-->00:01:06,773
So if we put this in and configure it,

15
00:01:07,740-->00:01:10,330
it by default will get you 10 rows.

16
00:01:10,330-->00:01:12,173
I'm gonna increase that to 25,

17
00:01:13,430-->00:01:16,350
and you can see that we have two outputs.

18
00:01:16,350-->00:01:21,270
We have the selected's output and the unselected output,

19
00:01:21,270-->00:01:23,103
and we have the standard column tab.

20
00:01:24,100-->00:01:28,183
So let's add two derived columns.

21
00:01:31,690-->00:01:34,090
So this one is the selected,

22
00:01:34,090-->00:01:37,360
and this one is the unselected.

23
00:01:37,360-->00:01:42,150
So we'll call that selected and unselected.

24
00:01:44,110-->00:01:45,410
So let's see what happens.

25
00:01:46,760-->00:01:49,340
So 847 go in,

26
00:01:49,340-->00:01:51,120
25 goes into selected,

27
00:01:51,120-->00:01:54,060
822 goes into unselected.

28
00:01:54,060-->00:02:04,040
So let's put on a Data Viewer but only on the selected because it's otherwise causing us a few problems to have two Data Viewers open.

29
00:02:04,040-->00:02:05,560
So here we have one,

30
00:02:05,560-->00:02:06,840
and we start off with,

31
00:02:06,840-->00:02:08,523
if you just have a look at the CustomerID,

32
00:02:08,523-->00:02:10,970
290, 29740,

33
00:02:10,970-->00:02:14,440
296474, and then number four.

34
00:02:14,440-->00:02:16,423
So it really is random.

35
00:02:19,190-->00:02:20,433
If I do it again,

36
00:02:21,750-->00:02:24,470
so remember number four was at last time,

37
00:02:24,470-->00:02:26,690
is number four part of that this time?

38
00:02:26,690-->00:02:27,523
No.

39
00:02:27,523-->00:02:30,300
Of course, I couldn't be sure until I actually ran it.

40
00:02:30,300-->00:02:31,133
It is random.

41
00:02:31,133-->00:02:33,720
Number four could well have been there this time.

42
00:02:33,720-->00:02:39,400
Now if you want a random sample but not so random, you want to be able to repeat it,

43
00:02:39,400-->00:02:41,520
you can specify the random seed,

44
00:02:41,520-->00:02:42,660
and have a look at this.

45
00:02:42,660-->00:02:47,820
Using the same random seed on the same input data always generates the same sample.

46
00:02:47,820-->00:02:49,930
So using for development and testing your package.

47
00:02:49,930-->00:02:52,740
Absolutely, you don't want to do it in real life.

48
00:02:52,740-->00:02:58,550
So now let's have a look at these random rows, and you can see it starts off at row number 40,

49
00:02:58,550-->00:02:59,720
and if I do it again,

50
00:02:59,720-->00:03:02,313
it will still start off at row number 40.

51
00:03:08,910-->00:03:13,010
So that is just the random sampling in a nut shell.

52
00:03:13,010-->00:03:15,230
We also have percentage sampling,

53
00:03:15,230-->00:03:17,710
which instead of saying 10 rows,

54
00:03:17,710-->00:03:20,620
we want, say, 10%,

55
00:03:20,620-->00:03:24,693
but I'll leave it for you to have a look at that in one of the practise activities.

56
00:03:25,900-->00:03:29,553
For now, let's go on to a different practise activity.
