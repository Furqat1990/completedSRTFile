of a business intelligence analyst

11

for AdventureWorks cycles.

12
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,980
Your role is to transform raw data

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,540
into reports and dashboards

14

to help the management team track KPIs,

15
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,890
compare regional performance,

16
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,570
analyze product-level trends,

17
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,360
and identify high-value customers.

18
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,193
But don't worry,

19
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:40,380
we'll be here to guide you along every step of the way.

20
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,780
We'll start by introducing Power BI Desktop

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,120
and the key stages of the BI workflow.

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,900
Data prep, modeling, analysis, and visualization.

23
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,010
From there, we'll connect

24
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,110
and shape our data with Power Query

25
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,990
and explore common connectors, storage modes,

26
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,710
profiling tools, table transformations, and more.

27
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,170
Next, we'll dive into relational data modeling,

28
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,990
introduce topics like cardinality, normalization,

29
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,030
filter flow, and star schemas,

30
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,240
and build our AdventureWorks model from the ground up.

31
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,590
With our model configured,

32
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,870
we'll create calculated columns and measures

33
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,230
using data analysis expressions, or DAX.

34
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,570
We'll discuss row and filter context,

35
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,370
review formula syntax,

36
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,800
and practice applying tools like filter functions,

37
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,500
iterators, and time intelligence patterns.

38
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,480
Finally, we'll bring our data to life

39
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,600
with professional-quality reports and dashboards.

40
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,270
We'll review visualization best practices,

41
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,370
build and format basic charts,

42
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,710
explore powerful AI visuals,

43
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,970
and add interactivity

44
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,910
with bookmarks, slicer panels and parameters,

45
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,850
custom tooltips, and report navigation.

46
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,683
Last but not least,

47
00:01:45,683 --> 00:01:47,670
we'll preview some of Power BIs native

48
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,040
and external optimization tools,

49
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,080
including the performance analyzer,

50
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,630
optimization presets, and more.
